1. Spiral print of a matrix
2. Given a tree (which has left, right, and previous pointers), you need to populate each previous pointer to point to its previous left node. If there is no previous left node, the previous pointer should be set to NULL.
3. Print all the possible permutations of a string. Then he asked me to modify my code so that there were no duplicates
4. To print all the subsequences of a string.
5. There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i]. It costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the station to its next (i + 1) station. Given two integer arrays of gas and cost, return the starting gas stationâ€™s index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction with enough gas, otherwise, return -1. He wanted an O(n) approach.
6. Implement a function which, given an array of integers, returns a new array for which every index carries the value of the product of the remaining elements - should be O(n)
7. Replace every array element by multiplication of previous and next

14. Consider a string S, that is a series of characters, each followed by its frequency as an integer. The string is not compressed correctly, so there may be multiple occurrences of the same character. A properly compressed string will consist of one instance of each character in alphabetical order followed by the total count of that character within the string.
    The string 'a3c9b2c1' has two instances where 'c is followed by a count: once with 9 occurrences, and again with 1. It should be compressed to 'a3b2c10'.
